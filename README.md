# express-optimizely-full-stack

A simple rudimentary express server integrated with Optimizely that serves a base or variant template based on an experiment config. The bucketing is done server-side via a server-side cookie, this ensures a user sees a consistent variant. The experiment example defined is currently set up in the Optimizely full-stack platform as a working POC
